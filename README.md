# Traditional-Data-Fusion
This repository shows  how to generate an object-level fused track list from measurements of a lidar and multiple camera sensors using a joint integrated probabilistic data association tracker. 
Different sensors capture different characteristics of objects in their field of view and have the potential to complement each other. 
<br>
Main steps in  the code:
# Generate 3D bounding box detections from LiDAR a sensor 
# Generate 2D bounding box detections from multiple camera sensors
# Fuse detections from LiDAR and camera sensors and track targets using a trackerJPDA object
